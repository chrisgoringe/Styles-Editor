# Things I hope to add

## Crawl (it's broken if this isn't done)

## Walk (definitely want to do)
- When editing additional styles but none selected, select one [53](https://github.com/chrisgoringe/Styles-Editor/issues/53)
- Better arrangement/styling of buttons 
- Move style to additional style file with context menu or similar

## Run (these might be nice)
- duplicate style (duplicate a row in the table)
- swap between multiple style files
- add style from txt2img or img2img prompts
- copy selected styles between tabs not just prompt (not really this extension, but a pain)
- remove duplicate styles (or maybe find similar ones) [52](https://github.com/chrisgoringe/Styles-Editor/issues/52)

## Fly (probably not, but just imagine...)
- remote sharing of styles in a public database
