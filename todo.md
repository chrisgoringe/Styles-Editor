# Things I hope to add

## Crawl (it's broken if this isn't done)

## Walk (definitely want to do)
- Move style to additional style file with context menu or similar

## Run (these might be nice)
- duplicate style (duplicate a row in the table)
- add style from txt2img or img2img prompts
- copy selected styles between tabs not just prompt (not really this extension, but a pain)

## Fly (probably not, but just imagine...)
- remote sharing of styles in a public database
