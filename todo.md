# Things I hope to add
Feel free to open an issue if there's something else you'd like!

## Crawl (it's broken if this isn't done)

## Walk (really ought to do these)

## Run (these might be nice)
- add style from txt2img or img2img prompts [https://github.com/chrisgoringe/Styles-Editor/issues/77]
- copy selected styles between tabs not just prompt (not really this extension, but a pain)

## Fly (probably never going to happen, but just imagine...)
- remote sharing of styles in a public database
